split method is mainly used for getting multiple inputs from user along with white space

program
x,y,z = input("enter the three value :").split('0')
print("total number of students: ",x)
print("number of boys is : ",y)
print("number of girls is :",z)

output

total number of students:  56 
number of boys is :   76 
number of girls is :  98

end method

end()

we can concatentate our input values with different symbols

program

apple=100
banana=200
pineapple=300
print(apple,end=' ')
print(banana,end=' ')
print(pineapple)
print(apple,banana,pineapple)

output

100 200 300
100 200 300

loops 

for loop

for i in range (10,0,-1)
    print(i,end="*")
output
